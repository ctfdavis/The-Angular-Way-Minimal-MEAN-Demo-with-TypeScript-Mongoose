# The Angular Way

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4.

The demo project is now completed.

It is a project for a series of posts on my blog in which I focus on the fundamentals of using Angular for the frontend, and TypeScript, Express & Mongoose for the backend:
